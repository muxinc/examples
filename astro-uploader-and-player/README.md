# Mux Video

This example uses Mux Video, an API-first platform for video. The example features video uploading and playback in a Astro.js application.

This example is useful if you want to build a platform that supports user-uploaded videos. For example:

- Enabling user profile videos
- Accepting videos for a video contest promotion
- Allowing customers to upload screencasts that help with troubleshooting a bug
- Or even the next Youtube, TikTok, or Instagram

## üßû Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## How to use

### Step 1. Create an account in Mux

All you need to run this example is a [Mux account](https://www.mux.com?utm_source=astro-examples&utm_medium=mux-video&utm_campaign=astro-examples).

Before entering a credit card on your Mux account, all videos are in ‚Äútest mode‚Äù which means they are watermarked and clipped to 10 seconds.

### Step 2. Set up environment variables

Copy the `.env.example` file in this directory to `.env` (which will be ignored by Git):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, go to the [settings page](https://dashboard.mux.com/settings/access-tokens) in your Mux dashboard, get a new **API Access Token** with "Mux Video Read" and "Mux Video Write" permissions. Use that token to set the variables in `.env.local`:

- `MUX_TOKEN_ID` should be the `TOKEN ID` of your new token
- `MUX_TOKEN_SECRET` should be `TOKEN SECRET`

At this point, you're good to `npm run dev`.

## How it works

Uploading and viewing a video takes four steps:

1. **Upload a video**: Use the Mux [Direct Uploads API](https://docs.mux.com/api-reference#video/tag/direct-uploads?utm_source=astro-examples&utm_medium=mux-video&utm_campaign=astro-examples) to create an endpoint for [Mux Uploader React](https://docs.mux.com/guides/mux-uploader?utm_source=astro-examples&utm_medium=mux-video&utm_campaign=astro-examples). The user can then use Mux Uploader to upload a video.
1. **Exchange the `upload.id` for an `asset.id`**: Once the upload is complete, it will have a Mux asset associated with it. We can use the [Direct Uploads API](https://docs.mux.com/api-reference#video/tag/direct-uploads?utm_source=astro-examples&utm_medium=mux-video&utm_campaign=astro-examples) to check for that asset.
1. **Use the `asset.id` to check if the asset is ready** by polling the [Asset API](https://docs.mux.com/api-reference#video/tag/assets?utm_source=astro-examples&utm_medium=mux-video&utm_campaign=astro-examples)
1. **Play back the video with [Mux Player React](https://docs.mux.com/guides/mux-player-web?utm_source=astro-examples&utm_medium=mux-video&utm_campaign=astro-examples)** (on a page that uses the [Mux Image API](https://docs.mux.com/guides/get-images-from-a-video) to provide og images)

These steps correspond to the following routes:

1. [`index.astro`](src/pages/index.astro) creates the upload, and exchanges the `upload.id` for an `asset.id` in an action which redirects to...
2. [`status/[assetId].astro`](src/pages/status/[assetId].astro) polls the Mux API to see if the asset is ready. When it is, we redirect to...
3. [`playback/[playbackId].astro`](src/pages/playback/[playbackId].astro) plays the video.

## Preparing for Production

### Set the cors_origin

When creating uploads, this demo sets `cors_origin: "*"` in the [`src/pages/index.astro`](src/pages/index.astro) file. For extra security, you should update this value to be something like `cors_origin: 'https://your-app.com'`, to restrict uploads to only be allowed from your application.

### Consider webhooks

In this example, we poll the Mux API to see if our asset is ready. In production, you'll likely have a database where you can store the `upload.id` and `asset.id`, and you can use [Mux Webhooks](https://docs.mux.com/guides/listen-for-webhooks) to get notified when your upload is complete, and when your asset is ready.

You can see an example of a webhook in [`src/pages/webhook.json.ts`](src/pages/webhook.json.ts).
