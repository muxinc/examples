# Mux Spaces iOS SDK Sample

This is an iOS and iPadOS app written in Swift demonstrating using the Spaces SDK to add real-time video and audio to your app.

## Getting Started

You'll need to install the Spaces SDK in order to use the sample app. The SDK is available [here](https://github.com/muxinc/mux-spaces-sdk-swift-distribution). Installation instructions are available [here](https://docs.mux.com/guides/video/send-and-receive-real-time-video-from-a-swiftui-ios-application#install-the-sdk-using-swift-package-manager).

A step-by-step Getting Started guide that builds a simplified version of this example app can be found [here](https://docs.mux.com/guides/video/send-and-receive-real-time-video-from-a-swiftui-ios-application).
