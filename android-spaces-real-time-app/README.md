# Mux Spaces Android SDK Example

This is an Android app demonstrating using the Spaces SDK to add real-time video and audio to your app. It is the same code as developed in the Getting Started guide [here](https://docs.mux.com/guides/video/send-and-receive-real-time-video-from-an-android-application)

## Getting Started

It is strongly recommended to follow the Getting Started guide [here](https://docs.mux.com/guides/video/send-and-receive-real-time-video-from-an-android-application) and to run on actual non emulated devices.

As mentioned in the guide, you will need to replace `final String jwt = "YOUR JWT";` in MainActivity with your appropriate Mux JWT in order to run this example. For production use the JWT should be retrieved from a server at runtime.
