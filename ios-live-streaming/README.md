# ios-live-streaming

An example app for live streaming from an iOS device using the [Mux](http://mux.com) live streaming service, written in [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/).

[![Swift Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-swift%204.0-brightgreen.svg)](https://developer.apple.com/swift) [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-lightgrey.svg)](https://github.com/muxinc/example-ios-live-streaming/blob/master/LICENSE)

## Welcome

Our sample app uses a couple open source projects and Xcode configurations in order to get live streaming up and running quickly. To make this easy, we recommend using the [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) dependency manager for iOS. Once you have cloned this repo and installed CocoaPods, you are a couple steps away from streaming.

## Quick Start

### Sample Project Setup

After cloning this project and installing [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html), run the following command from the project directory to get setup:

```sh
pod install
```

Then just open the workspace and click play to build and run.

```sh
open *workspace
```
